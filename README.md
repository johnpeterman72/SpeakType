   - Check Windows microphone permissions
   - Ensure default microphone is set correctly
   - Try adjusting `energy_threshold` in config

3. **Recognition errors**
   - Check internet connection
   - Speak more clearly and closer to microphone
   - Adjust `phrase_time_limit` for longer sentences

4. **Application won't start**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
